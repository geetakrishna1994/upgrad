Problem Statement :

A classic problem in the field of pattern recognition is that of handwritten digit recognition. Suppose that you have images of handwritten digits ranging from 0-9 written by various people in boxes of a specific size - similar to the application forms in banks and universities.
The goal is to develop a model that can correctly identify the digit (between 0-9) written in an image.

For this problem, we use the MNIST data which is a large database of handwritten digits. The 'pixel values' of each digit (image) comprise the features, and the actual number between 0-9 is the label.
